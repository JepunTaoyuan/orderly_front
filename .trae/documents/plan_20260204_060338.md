I will completely rewrite the `LeaderboardProfile` component to strictly follow the full layout code provided by the user.

### Plan
I will replace the existing implementation with the exact HTML/CSS structure provided in the user's snippet. This includes:
1.  **Main Container**: `width: 100%`, `padding: 24px`, `background: #131519`, `gap: 20px`.
2.  **Header Section**: "Points You Earned" title and "Share" button with precise dimensions and borders.
3.  **User Info Card**:
    *   Specific `width: 317px` (or 100% of parent), `padding: 20px`.
    *   Avatar `76x94px` with specific border.
    *   Name and ID labels/values with exact font sizes (12px/13px) and colors.
4.  **Stats Cards**:
    *   `width: 317px`, `padding: 20px`, `gap: 10px`.
    *   Inner blocks `125x68px` with `gap: 8px`.
5.  **Spacing**: Ensure the `gap: 3px` (from previous instruction context, though the new snippet uses a flex column with gaps) or strictly follow the snippet's `gap` properties. The user mentioned "spacing between profile and table is 3px" which might be outside this component, but within this component, I will strictly use the provided snippet's structure.
    *   *Correction*: The user said "gap between profile and table is 3px" in the text, but the snippet provides the *internal* structure of the profile component. I will focus on making the profile component match the snippet exactly.

### File to Modify
