I will update the User Info Card text styling as requested.

### Changes
1.  **Text Color**: Change the color of the "Name" and "ID" labels to `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.54)` (standard secondary text color) or strictly `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)` if preferred. I will use a custom style or the closest utility class to match the requested opacity.
2.  **Alignment**: Ensure the text blocks are explicitly left-aligned (although they appeared to be `itemAlign="start"` previously, I will double-check the `Box` containers).

### File to Modify
*   `app/packages/trading-leaderboard/components/leaderboard/profile/leaderboardProfile.ui.tsx`
