I will update the spacing in the `LeaderboardProfile` component to match the specific pixel values requested.

### Changes
1.  **Stats Cards Spacing**:
    *   Reduce the bottom margin (`mb`) of the "Overall" card to achieve a `3px` spacing between the two cards.
    *   Currently, it uses `mb={3}` (which is typically 12px in standard spacing scales). I will use a direct style or specific class to set the margin to exactly `3px`.

2.  **Main Container Padding**:
    *   Increase the padding of the main `LeaderboardProfile` container from `p={4}` (16px) to `24px` (`p={6}` or explicit style).
    *   Ensure the User Info Card inside also maintains consistent spacing if needed, but the request specifically targets "outer and inner container padding" which likely refers to the main wrapper.

### File to Modify
*   `app/packages/trading-leaderboard/components/leaderboard/profile/leaderboardProfile.ui.tsx`
